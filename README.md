Predicting crab age is crucial for optimizing harvest timing in commercial crab farming and managing
marine ecosystems.  This project aims to predict the age of crabs using their physical measurements and characteristics.
The dataset includes data on 3893 crabs, focusing on parameters like length, weight, and gender.
The analysis begins with data preprocessing and exploration, revealing growth
patterns and differences between crab species. Four models (Multiple Linear Regression, Elastic Net
Regression, K-nearest neighbors, and CART) are fitted and compared using metrics like Mean Absolute
Error and R-squared. Results show all models achieve around 50% accuracy in predicting crab age, with
K-Nearest Neighbors performing slightly better. Suggestions for improvement include feature
engineering and exploring alternative models. Language: R.
